    "- PNG vs. JPG\n",
    "    - JPG uses lossy compression while PNG uses lossless, which is also why PNG files tend to be bigger. JPG uses a compression algorithm based on DCT.\n",
    "- Check line drawing algos\n",
    "    - By using the y = mx + c, you can find which pixels the straight line goes through at each x. For a thinner line you could decide to choose only one pixel to use in each column if the line goes through two of them, especially if the line is more horizontal. Depending on the angle of the line this may change."
